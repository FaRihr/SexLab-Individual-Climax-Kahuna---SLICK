# **SLICK** - **S**ex**L**ab **I**ndividual **C**limax **K**ahuna
is a modification based on [SexLab p+ v2.x](https://discord.gg/mycaxFPSeV) that introduces actual impact on animation branching and orgasm handling based on individual participant statistical values.

Another feature that will be included is a legacy API to provide backwards compatibility for special Papyrus functions provided by [SexLab Separate Orgasm SE](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5929-sexlab-separate-orgasm-se/) even though this will require some updates by mod authors. Only in planning for now.

## Requirements
An up-and-running setup which includes
- [SexLab p+ v2.x](https://discord.gg/mycaxFPSeV)
- [Sexlab Aroused NG](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/27713-alpha-sexlab-aroused-ng/) *or* [SexLab Aroused eXtended](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/10461-sexlab-aroused-extended/) *or* [Sexlab Aroused Redux SSE](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5482-sexlab-aroused-redux-sse-version-29/)
  - OSL Aroused isn't fully compatible yet as it doesn't provide all features

## Features
### Included
- provision of a magic effect to all participants of a sex act
- initial calculation of required stats based on external values
- Partial backwards compatibility to [SLSO](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5929-sexlab-separate-orgasm-se/)
- basic scene manipulation based on calculated stats

### WIP
- better calculation algorithms for the stats
- better and more fine grained scene manipulation

### Planned
- Highly customizable calculation of authentic stat values based on external data
- deep control over scene flow based on stats and external values
- Fully backwards compatible function API for [SLSO](https://www.loverslab.com/files/file/5929-sexlab-separate-orgasm-se/) provided Papyrus functions (will require some patching nonetheless!)
